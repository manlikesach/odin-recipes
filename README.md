Project Introduction – Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project’s HTML Foundations curriculum. You'll build a basic website called "Odin Recipes" that includes a homepage and multiple recipe pages. The site will be structured using folders and linked HTML files.

By the end of this project, you'll have demonstrated key skills in:

    Structuring a multi-page website with semantic HTML

    Creating and linking internal pages using <a> tags

    Organizing files using directories (recipes/)

    Writing clean, readable HTML using elements like <h1>, <img>, <ul>, and <p>

This project solidifies your understanding of HTML fundamentals and prepares you to move on to CSS and more advanced topics.
